- Required module: prettytable

## Features

1. Add Contact: Add a new contact with a name and phone number.
2. Search Contact: Search for a contact by name or phone number.
3. Display Phonebook: View the entire phonebook with contacts sorted alphabetically.
4. Inorder Check: Check the order of nodes in the binary search tree (for debugging purposes).
5. Edit Contact: Modify the name or phone number of an existing contact.
6. Delete Contact: Delete a contact from the phonebook.
7. Exit: Save the phonebook data and exit the program.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the main Python file.
2. Choose the desired operation from the menu by entering the corresponding option number.
3. Follow the prompts and enter the required information to perform the selected operation.
4. The phonebook data is automatically saved to the "sathvikdata.txt" file when exiting the program.

## File Structure

- `sathvikdata.txt`: Stores the contact data in a serialized format.
